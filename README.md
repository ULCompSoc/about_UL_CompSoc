Who are we?




The Computer Society will be running this year in line with all COVID safety guidelines. Last semester we were able to continue running events well into lockdown safely. We had events such as a Virtual Pub where members got together on our dedicated Skynet video chat meet.skynet.ie and had a bit of much needed banter.

We ran Minecraft events on our server "Skycraft" which all members are allowed access, one such project was building the foundation building, the exterior is complete and work on the interior is ongoing, you can see photos of it below.

We ran our annual "Show and Tell" virtually this year, every year members can take part and show off a project they worked on (doesn't have to be from the university or even from that year) and then the members rank each participant, top 3 participants win prizes. If we are able to safely have in-person events we will do so and we will follow every guideline to keep everyone safe. If not we have plenty of events we can run virtually. Regardless we have plenty of services available with our computing cluster "Skynet", such as the aforementioned "Skycraft" minecraft server.

We have a Discord channel where you can get up to date with all the latest society news, have discussions with current members etc, link is on the left of this page.


The computer society is for people who are interested in computers and computer software such as:

• Computer Software and Hardware

• Robotics

• Vitual Reality

• New Technology

• Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)

• Computer Games

• Education and Outreach

...but don’t let that scare you!

We run weekly meet-ups where we dive into all things tech. We hold various events from programming competitions to movie nights. We are friendly to all levels of expertise whether you’re a programming expert or you just want to check out our virtual reality set up. We often hold technology related talks and our past presenters include companies such as Google, Microsoft, Analog Devices, ACI and many more. We also boast trips abroad our most recent one being to Paris and Milan.

We have lots of plans ahead for the society so why not come up and ask us all about it?

At the heart of the society is the computing cluster affectionately known as Skynet. All members get access to all of skynets services. Many of the people who maintain this cluster have been drawn from the society. This experience can be found invaluable when looking for jobs in later life. We also appropriately named all the machines after artificial intelligences from movies and tv. For more information on Skynet check out this link.
