Who are we?

The computer society is for people who are interested in computer hardware and software. Events we have done previously and/or will continue to do include:

* Social/casual meetups (currently virtual pubs)

* Informative talks featuring speakers from the industry

* A show and tell with our members, with prizes awarded to those with the best projects (Nintendo Switch, Raspberri Pi)

* Gaming (Minecraft, on our very own server, Skycraft!, Among Us) 

Planned events include: 

* More virtual pubs and talks 

* Accessing your Skynet account and hosting your own website

* Programming events (code-off?) 

* Setup Wars. Show off your work from home/gaming setup! (Just Eat vouchers to be won) 

* Compsoc VS the Games Society in CSGO or some other game. 

At the heart of the society is the computing cluster affectionately known as Skynet. All members get access to all of Skynet's services. Many of the people who maintain this cluster have been drawn from the society. This experience can be found invaluable when looking for jobs in later life. We also appropriately named all the machines after artificial intelligences from movies and tv. For more information on Skynet check out this link.

The Computer Society will be running this year in line with all COVID safety guidelines. Last semester we were able to continue running events well into lockdown safely. We had events such as a Virtual Pub where members got together on our dedicated Skynet video chat meet.skynet.ie and had a bit of much needed banter.

We have a Discord server, where you can get up to date with all the latest society news, have discussions with current members etc, link is on the left of this page.

--- Below this is probably too much, seems like repetition as it is compied from the soc description --- 

The computer society is for people who are interested in computers and computer software such as:

• Computer Software and Hardware

• Robotics

• Vitual Reality

• New Technology

• Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)

• Computer Games

• Education and Outreach

...but don’t let that scare you!

We run weekly meet-ups where we dive into all things tech. We hold various events from programming competitions to movie nights. We are friendly to all levels of expertise whether you’re a programming expert or you just want to check out our virtual reality set up. We often hold technology related talks and our past presenters include companies such as Google, Microsoft, Analog Devices, ACI and many more. We also boast trips abroad our most recent one being to Paris and Milan.

We have lots of plans ahead for the society so why not come up and ask us all about it?
